garden lamp controller

This is a project which is about a pcb and its software that controls two lamps in my garden. The lamps are switched on when the sun goes down and switched off when the sun comes up.

The times of the sunset and sunrise are fetched from the internet. Also the current time is fetched from the internet. The main controller is an ARM microprocesser (LPC1114). The network connection is done by a wifi interface (ESP8266).

The pcb is designed with kicad. The microcontroller program will be written in C (not checked in yet). Be patient.
