garden lamp controller

This is a project which is about a pcb and its software that controls two lamp in my garden. The lamps are switched on when the sun goes down and switched off when the sun comes up.

The time of the sunset and sunrise are fetched from the internet. The current time is also fetched from the internet. The main controller is an ARM microprocesser (LPC1114) and an wifi interface (ESP8266).

The ppcb is designed with kicad. Microcontroller program is will be written in C (not checked in yet). Be patient.
